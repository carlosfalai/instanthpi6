**TRACKING FOLDER**: `/Users/carlosfavielfont/instanthpi6/`

## 🎯 WHAT THIS PROJECT IS
- **Complete medical practice management system**
- **Restricted to Dr. Carlos Faviel Font only**
- **Uses OpenAI + Claude APIs with doctor's own API keys**
- **Production-ready and deployed**

## ❌ WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT DO

2. **USE** the existing enhanced system in `instanthpi-ollama/`
3. **MAINTAIN** OpenAI + Claude integration
4. **KEEP** user restriction to Dr. Carlos Faviel Font only
5. **USE** doctor's own API keys from database
6. **FOLLOW** the established architecture

## 🔍 HOW TO START WORK
1. **FIRST**: Read `PROJECT_STATUS.md` in this folder
2. **SECOND**: Check the current system in `instanthpi-ollama/`
3. **THIRD**: Understand what's already implemented
4. **FOURTH**: Only make changes that build on existing system

2. **Creating new projects** - The system is already complete
3. **Ignoring user restrictions** - Only Dr. Carlos Faviel Font can access
4. **Using hardcoded API keys** - Doctor manages their own keys
5. **Recreating existing features** - Check what's already there first

## 📋 WORKFLOW FOR NEW FEATURES
1. **Check existing system** - What's already implemented?
2. **Identify gaps** - What actually needs to be added?
3. **Build on existing** - Don't recreate, enhance
4. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure AI integration works
5. **Update documentation** - Keep tracking files current

## 🔄 WHEN USER ASKS FOR CHANGES
1. **Understand the request** - What exactly is needed?
2. **Check current system** - Is it already there?
3. **Identify the gap** - What's missing?
