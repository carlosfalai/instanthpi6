## 🔍 WHEN USER MAKES REQUESTS

### 1. Understand the Request
- [ ] What exactly is the user asking for?
- [ ] Is this a new feature or modification?
- [ ] Does this conflict with existing functionality?

### 2. Check Current System
- [ ] Is this feature already implemented?
- [ ] What's the current approach?
- [ ] How does this fit with existing architecture?

### 3. Plan Implementation
- [ ] How to build on existing system?
- [ ] What changes are needed?
- [ ] How to maintain AI integration?
- [ ] How to preserve user restrictions?

### 4. Implement Changes
- [ ] Make changes to existing system
- [ ] Test AI integration still works
- [ ] Verify user restrictions remain
- [ ] Update documentation if needed

### 5. Verify Results
- [ ] System still works correctly
- [ ] AI integration functional
- [ ] User restrictions maintained
- [ ] New features work as expected
