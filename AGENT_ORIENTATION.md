# 🧭 Agent Orientation - InstantHPI6

## 🚨 FIRST TIME HERE? READ THIS!

### You are working on InstantHPI6 - a COMPLETE medical practice management system

## 📍 WHERE TO GO
- **Active System**: `/Users/carlosfavielfont/instanthpi-ollama/`
- **Tracking Files**: `/Users/carlosfavielfont/instanthpi6/` (this folder)

## 🎯 WHAT YOU'RE WORKING ON
A complete medical practice management system that:
- ✅ Uses OpenAI + Claude APIs (NOT Ollama)
- ✅ Is restricted to Dr. Carlos Faviel Font only
- ✅ Has doctor-managed API keys
- ✅ Includes complete medical practice features
- ✅ Is production-ready and deployed

## 🚀 QUICK START (30 seconds)
```bash
cd /Users/carlosfavielfont/instanthpi-ollama
npm start
```
- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
- **Login**: carlosfont / CarlosFont2024!

## 📋 ESSENTIAL FILES TO READ
1. **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - What's implemented and working
2. **AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Critical do's and don'ts
3. **QUICK_START.md** - How to access the system
4. **CHANGE_LOG.md** - What's been built

## ❌ CRITICAL: DO NOT DO THESE
- ❌ Fall back to Ollama (old approach)
- ❌ Create new projects from scratch
- ❌ Ignore user restriction requirements
- ❌ Use hardcoded API keys
- ❌ Recreate existing features

## ✅ WHAT YOU SHOULD DO
- ✅ Use the existing system in `instanthpi-ollama/`
- ✅ Maintain OpenAI + Claude integration
- ✅ Keep user restriction to Dr. Carlos Faviel Font only
- ✅ Build on existing architecture
- ✅ Test AI integration after changes

## 🔍 HOW TO VERIFY YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK
1. **Check the system**: Does `instanthpi-ollama/server.js` have OpenAI + Claude imports?
2. **Check the database**: Does it have API key columns for users?
3. **Check the dashboard**: Does it have AI settings tab?
4. **Check the login**: Does it work with carlosfont / CarlosFont2024!?

## 🚨 RED FLAGS - STOP AND READ
If you see any of these, STOP and read the tracking files:
- User mentions "Ollama" or "old approach"
- User asks to "start over" or "create new project"
- User wants to remove AI integration
- User wants to change user restrictions
- User mentions working on different project

## 📊 CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS
- **Status**: ✅ Complete and functional
- **AI Integration**: ✅ OpenAI + Claude working
- **User Access**: ✅ Dr. Carlos Faviel Font only
- **Features**: ✅ All medical practice features implemented
- **Deployment**: ✅ Production ready

## 🎯 YOUR MISSION
Enhance the existing system, don't recreate it. The system is complete and working. Your job is to:
- Add new features that build on existing architecture
- Fix bugs without breaking existing functionality
- Maintain AI integration and user restrictions
- Keep the system secure and functional

## 📞 WHEN IN DOUBT
- Read the tracking files in this folder
- Check the current system in `instanthpi-ollama/`
- Understand what's already implemented
- Build on existing system, don't recreate
