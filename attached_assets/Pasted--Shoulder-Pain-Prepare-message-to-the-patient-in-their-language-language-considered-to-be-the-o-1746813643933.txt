🩺 Shoulder Pain
☐ Prepare message to the patient in their language (language considered to be the one used in the SMS-based secure messaging system to communicate with us)
☐ Prepare Spartan SOAP note (Make a super spartan note, no unnecessary details, no formatting, no fluff. Strict minimum like a real doctor would write. No stating 'Examen: Non réalisé'. Keep the plan to only essential interventions, ideally in one line.)
☐ This is a complex case: put all the details in the subjective part, so that we can find it in the final SOAP note.
☐ Prepare message since I suspect rotator cuff tear requiring urgent orthopedic evaluation (red flags: traumatic injury with immediate weakness, significant night pain, inability to raise arm, positive drop arm test, audible pop during injury)

Investigations and initial evaluation:
☐ Shoulder X-ray AP, lateral, axillary views
☐ Ultrasound MSK of shoulder for rotator cuff pathology, bursitis, or impingement
☐ MRI of shoulder without contrast
☐ MRI of shoulder with contrast (for labral tears)
☐ MR arthrogram of shoulder
☐ CT scan of shoulder
☐ EMG/NCS for suspected nerve involvement
☐ Complete blood count (CBC)
☐ Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
☐ C-reactive protein (CRP)
☐ Rheumatoid factor
☐ Anti-CCP antibodies
☐ HLA-B27
