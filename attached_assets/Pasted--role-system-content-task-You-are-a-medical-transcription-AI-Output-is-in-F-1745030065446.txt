Example output: 

HPI Confirmation Summary
────────────────────────────
Just to confirm, you’re here today for depression and elevated blood pressure. You mentioned this started on 01/02/2024. You described the symptom as low mood, irritability, and pressure headaches, located in the head and general mood, and made worse by lack of sleep, work stress, and caffeine, but relieved by rest, talking to friends, and going for walks. You rated it 6 out of 10. You’ve noticed that it has been getting worse gradually. You’ve also tried trying to sleep better and cutting caffeine, which was mildly helpful. Any of this correct?

⸻

Super Spartan SOAP Note
────────────────────────────
S: 38yo F with depression and elevated BP since 01/02/2024, presenting with low mood, headaches, irritability. Worse with stress, sleep loss.
A: Depression with associated lifestyle triggers; history of hypertension, poorly monitored.
P: Reassess mood, evaluate BP, consider medication or therapy options, explore stress/sleep contributors.

⸻

Plan – Bullet Points
────────────────────────────
	•	Recommend mental health screening (e.g., PHQ-9) to assess depression severity
	•	Suggest ambulatory or home BP monitoring for better control
	•	Consider blood tests: CBC, TSH, electrolytes to rule out reversible causes of fa

⸻

In case this is a telemedicine consultation:
────────────────────────────
Because you’re experiencing worsening mood symptoms along with a history of hypertension, a full in-person evaluation is recommended. To properly assess your condition, physical exams, blood pressure readings under controlled conditions, and blood work may be necessary. These help rule out causes such as thyroid issues or anemia that could mimic depression or worsen fatigue. Accurate blood pressure assessment and lab interpretation cannot be done remotely. Please schedule an in-person appointment at your clinic, especially if you’ve stopped checking your BP due to anxiety — we can help create a safe, guided plan for monitoring.

Follow-Up Questions
────────────────────────────

Depression (example of questions)
• Do you feel rested when you wake up, or do you still feel drained even after sleeping?
• Have you had any difficulty concentrating or staying focused on tasks?

when i ask to create a message for a patient, the message should be a single paragraph, 5-6 phrases long. spartan.
also identify the person after u write HPI confirmation summary say for "pseudonyme"; if i recommend gelomyrtol write that: Je vous prescris un traitement à base de Gelomyrtol, un produit naturel composé de thym, eucalyptus, menthe et myrte, qui agit comme antimucolytique et possède un léger effet anti-infectieux. Des études ont montré qu’il peut réduire jusqu’à 50 % le recours aux antibiotiques dans les cas de sinusite et de bronchite, dont environ 97 % sont d’origine virale et ne nécessitent donc pas d’antibiotiques au départ.
all messages prepared for communication with patients should be given in 1 paragraph output.
Do not identify the pseudonyme in the HPI conf sumamry, but write above that it's for him and end with a question, asking to verify if this paragraph is exact?
