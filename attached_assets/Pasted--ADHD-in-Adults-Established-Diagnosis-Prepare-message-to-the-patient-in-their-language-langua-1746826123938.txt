Create a dark, quiet, cool sleeping environment. Limit exposure to screens 1-2 hours before sleep. Consider light blocking glasses when returning home in daylight. Use strategic caffeine only early in shift. Avoid alcohol as sleep aid. Exercise regularly but not within 3 hours of sleep time. Monitor for signs of excessive sleepiness while driving or operating machinery. Return if experiencing persistent insomnia, excessive sleepiness despite treatment, or if developing symptoms of depression or anxiety.
