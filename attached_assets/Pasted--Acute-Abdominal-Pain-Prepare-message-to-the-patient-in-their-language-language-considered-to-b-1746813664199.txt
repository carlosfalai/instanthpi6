🩺 Acute Abdominal Pain
☐ Prepare message to the patient in their language (language considered to be the one used in the SMS-based secure messaging system to communicate with us)
☐ Prepare Spartan SOAP note (Make a super spartan note, no unnecessary details, no formatting, no fluff. Strict minimum like a real doctor would write. No stating 'Examen: Non réalisé'. Keep the plan to only essential interventions, ideally in one line.)
