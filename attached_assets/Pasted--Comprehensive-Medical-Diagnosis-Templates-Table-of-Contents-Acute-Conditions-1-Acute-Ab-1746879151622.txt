☐ Counseling: Pneumonia is an infection of the lung tissue. Complete the full course of antibiotics even if feeling better. Rest and stay well-hydrated. Use incentive spirometry or deep breathing exercises 10 times every hour while awake. Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke. Fever, fatigue, and cough may persist for several weeks even as the infection resolves. Return immediately if experiencing worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion, inability to keep fluids down, or high persistent fever. Follow up for repeat chest X-ray in 6-12 weeks to ensure complete resolution.

☐ This is a complex case: put all the details in the subjective part, so that we can find it in the final SOAP note.
